# History of Math

## Introduction

Mathematics has been a part of human history for thousands of years. From counting on fingers to complex equations, math has evolved alongside civilizations.

---

## Early Beginnings

The earliest form of math can be traced back to ancient civilizations like the Babylonians and Egyptians. They developed basic systems for counting and measuring.

## The Renaissance and Beyond

In the Renaissance, European scholars like Descartes and Newton advanced math by integrating it with scientific discoveries, leading to the creation of calculus.
