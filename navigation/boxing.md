# License Selection and Project Overview

## Task 1: Select a License for Your Personal Repository
For my personal repository, I have chosen the **MIT License**. This license is highly permissive with minimal restrictions, making it easy for others to use, modify, and distribute the code. Its simplicity promotes collaboration and open-source contributions.

## Task 2: Explain Your Choice
The MIT License benefits my project by reducing legal barriers for other developers and users who want to integrate or build upon my work. Its permissive nature encourages contributions and innovation while ensuring that proper attribution is maintained. This makes it ideal for a personal repository where flexibility and ease of use are priorities.

## Task 3: Add the License to Your Repository
I have created a `LICENSE` file in my personal repository that includes the full text of the MIT License, along with my name and the current year.

## Task 4: Define Your Project - DataMango
**DataMango** is a project focused on utilizing prediction models along with public data from the City of Poway to generate heat maps of traffic patterns. It leverages crowdsourcing to enhance data accuracy and provide real-time insights into traffic trends. Key features include predictive analytics, interactive visualizations, and integration of public and crowdsourced data for comprehensive traffic modeling.

## Task 5: Add the License to Your CPT/Pilot City Project
For the **DataMango** project, a different license has been applied. I have added a `LICENSE` file to the project repository that contains the full text of the **Apache License**. This license was selected because it maintains important copyright and license notices while allowing for
broad distribution and modification.  
For more details, please refer to our project license available [here](https://github.com/Tvick22/DataMango/blob/main/LICENSE).
