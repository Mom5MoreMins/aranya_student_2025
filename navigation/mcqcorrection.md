**What you learned from quiz?**  
I learned from this quiz that I still have a lot to learn, but also that the quiz not only contains questions about coding, but also descriptions of things like IPs, reading graphs and tables, how to prevent things like copyright strikes, binary sequences, and things that include some cybersecurity knowledge.

**What type of questions do you feel you are weak on?**  
I was weak on questions that had multiple right answers, as with other questions I could use the process of elimination to identify questions that make the most sense, but with multiple choice the questions were more vague.

**Corrections on anything you got wrong.**

- **Q1.**  
  Which of the following best describes one of the benefits of using an iterative and incremental process of program development?  
  My answer: A, It allows programmers to implement algorithmic solutions to otherwise unsolvable problems.  
  Correction: D, It helps programmers identify errors as components are added to a working program.  
  D is the correct answer because adding small segments at a time to code allows programmers to identify errors in the newer components so that they can focus on those new components.

- **Q3.**  
  Which of the following best compares the values displayed by programs A and B?  
  My answer: B, Program A and program B display the same values in different orders.  
  Correction: C, Program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ.  
  C is correct, as program A lists 1-10 while program B lists 2-11.

- **Q5.**  
  A user reads reviews of a popular artist’s new album and then downloads the album from the Web site of a licensed online music seller. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be a consequence of this action?  
  My answer: B, Album reviews from other people who live nearby will be displayed to the user.  
  Correction: D, The user will be in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  
  The user downloads the music from a licensed online music seller's website, so it is unlikely that they would face a violation of the DMCA.

- **Q9.**  
  For which of the following strings is it NOT possible to use byte pair encoding to shorten the string’s length?  
  My answer: C, "MEET_ME_LATER"  
  Correction: B, "LEVEL_UP"  
  Byte pair encoding cannot shorten this string because it lacks repeating character pairs.

- **Q12.**  
  The following grid shows a robot in a square grid. Which of the following replacements for missing code can be used to move the robot to the gray square?  
  My answer: B  
  Correction: A  
  The robot cannot rotate right at the beginning, so it will move forward regardless of the if statement.

- **Q18.**  
  A video-streaming service uses a procedure that takes approximately 1 hour to return results for each genre. What is the total execution time of the program?  
  My answer: A, 1 hour  
  Correction: D, 5 hours  
  It takes 1 hour for each of the 5 genres, resulting in 5 hours total.

- **Q29.**  
  For which of the following input values will the circuit have an output of false?  
  My answer: D  
  Correction: A  
  A is correct because the AND gate will output false, and the OR gates will not convert it to true.

- **Q64.**  
  Which of the following statements describe how cloud computing has affected Internet communication?  
  My answer: A, B  
  Correction: B, C  
  C is correct because cloud computing has introduced new data security concerns.

- **Q65.**  
  A program is created to perform arithmetic operations on positive and negative integers. Under which conditions will the procedure NOT return the correct product?  
  My answer: B, C  
  Correction: B, D  
  D is correct because if y is negative, then count = y will never be met.

- **Q66.**  
  For which of the following values of `theList` will Smallest(theList) NOT return the intended value?  
  My answer: B, C  
  Correction: C, D  
  B is incorrect because 10 is the first value smaller than the first number, so it will return 10.  
  D is correct because the procedure will incorrectly return 30.
